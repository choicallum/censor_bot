A plug-in for a Discord Bot that automatically catches any message including the words "poggers" and "objectively" and deletes it, and sends a new message including the user's
name and the same message, with any instance of those words being censored.  

While made as a joke, it could be repurposed to delete or censor actual inflammatory content, such as racial or homophobic slurs.
